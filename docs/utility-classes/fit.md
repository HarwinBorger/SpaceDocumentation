# Fit
Fit removes white space from the line-height so it fit's perfectly to it's container. 

::: warning Please notice:
Currently this only works combined with `.align-baseline` and `.align-capline` classes. The standalone .fit class has yet to come.

## Introduction

### Benefits of using .fit classs
- No longer you need to give your padding strange values to compensate for line-heights. 

## Example
#### Before .align-baseline and .fit
<Utility-Fit-Fit-Before />

#### After .align-baseline and .fit
<Utility-Fit-Fit-After />

## Requirements

## Specifications
**Classname:** `.fit`
